# AIRLOCK CLIENT - First Host-Only mod for Among Us 3D/VR!

Airlock Client has been a project I've been working on in some spare free time and I'm finally glad to have it out! Airlock Client currently provides 3 new game modes along with returns!

# Features
## New Modes
### More Roles <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b915d93f-b290-4b70-8105-542edc5c279f" alt="emoji" width="50" height="50">

Adds more roles to the fray! Classic modded roles like Lover and Sheriff return, along with new ones catered to the game's native proximity chat.

### Hide N Seek (3D Edition) <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4489f720-1c4b-4066-8b61-d8fe207f7c23" alt="emoji" width="50" height="50">

The classic game mode from *Among Us* has been brought into the third dimension! The crew rushes to finish tasks whilst hiding from the Imposter, but once the 'Final Hide' starts, it's every bean for themselves!

### Sandbox <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bab61f89-7084-4e74-9288-9c19e123a35f" alt="emoji" width="50" height="50">

Inspired by *Garry's Mod* and *Among Us*'s Freeplay mode, Sandbox lets you freely roam around any map without waiting for the lobby to fill up. You can also test the aforementioned custom roles with friends, practice tasks, explore maps, etc using this!

## Returning Modes
### Lights Out <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac1f70ca-6db4-42b1-8353-7fedbd56b5bc" alt="emoji" width="50" height="50">

Engineers all around the area, lights dim, imposters lurking. This mode was created originally for the Engineer role when it had released.

### Infection <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89fd267c-342f-443e-b4e6-c146bd0efc44" alt="emoji" width="50" height="50">

The zomburittos have returned to spread once again! Complete your tasks as quickly as possible before the zomburittos spread their infection!

## Anti Cheat
Airlock Client's personal Anti Cheat for your own hosted vanilla lobbies! Modded lobbies are not supported yet.
